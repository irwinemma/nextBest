> **“Traditionally, marketers apply customer segmentation across the entire customer database. However, every customer is unique. Some organizations send the same messages to all customers or to all customers in a segment, but this might be seen as annoying SPAM and push customers away. So we decided to develop Next Best Action for each individual customer”**
